# About 
Check out app.js and you'll see the Couch Doc structure as required by the [BeLL System schema](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/BeLL-System/blob/1.x/Guide-for-Developers/Bell-Database-Schema.md). You'll find the HTML resources in attachments.  Other HTML resources could be built and pushed to BeLL Servers this way.

# Installation

npm install couchapp
couchapp push app.js {your BeLL server}/resources
